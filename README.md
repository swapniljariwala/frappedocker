## Frappe/ERPNext containers for development (Supports Apple M1 chips as well)

Main motivation behind creating this repository is to -

* Keep the process of building Frappe Docker transparent (It has all the Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration required to build)
* Support for other architectures (ie Apple M1 chips etc)

(This will potentially help a fellow mac m1 owner avoid a sleepless night trying to figure out how to run Frappe/ERPNext on M1)

## Pre-requisites

* Docker desktop
* Visual studio code

## Steps

**Clone this repo and open it in VS Code**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swapniljariwala/frappedocker.git
cd frappedocker
code .
```
last line `code .` opens the folder in `Visual studio code`.

**Setup Frappe**
